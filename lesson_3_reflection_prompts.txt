Q.
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.
Helpful incase of loss of data or change to a new device.

Q.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A.
So work doesn't get shifted from underneath your feet.
